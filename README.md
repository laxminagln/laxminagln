Multidisciplinary engineer with a B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the College of Engineering Trivandrum and over 2 years of experience as a Senior Software Engineer at Wipro. Currently pursuing an MSc in Robotics, with hands-on expertise in designing, assembling, and programming robotic systems.

Proficient in technologies such as Talend DI, Redshift, SQL, and Python, with a strong foundation in data integration and performance optimization. In parallel, I specialize in Robot Operating System (ROS), machine vision using Python, Internet of Things (IoT), and human-robot interactionâ€”bridging software engineering with intelligent automation.

I also bring a creative edge as a freelance graphic designer, crafting visually compelling designs using a variety of digital tools. Known for delivering high-quality results in collaborative environments, I am now seeking opportunities where I can combine my diverse technical skills to contribute to innovative, real-world solutions in robotics and AI-driven systems.

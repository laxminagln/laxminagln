I'm an Electrical and Electronics engineer who loves designing and programming robots. I'm always looking for ways to make my life more efficient, whether that be with software or hardware.

I currently work in several ETL technologies as a developer and freelancing as a graphic designer.

I also have a lot of interests outside of work, including singing, learning new languages and teaching.
